# Space-geometry

## Interface implementing basic geometric primitives in 3-dimensional space

1. Vector ⬆️
2. Ray ☀️
3. Sphere 🪩
4. Triangle 🔺
5. Intersection processing class 🖇️
6. Geometry methods class 📐

## Geometry methods class possibilities
1. Calculate intersection of a ray with a sphere
2. Calculate intersection of a ray with a polygon
3. Determine if a point lies in a polygon
4. Create a reflection of a ray with respect to the surface normal
5. Calculate barycentric coordinates
